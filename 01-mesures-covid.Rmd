# MESURES COVID {-}

We’ve been going through an unprecedented period over the past 3 years and a bit. We’re required to comply with current public health rules.

Although these rules have become much less strict as both federal and provincial governments have lifted isolation mandates, we ask everyone to use common sense, pay attention to possible symptoms and test and isolate themselves if necessary.

Hand hygiene remains fundamental: in the context of a camping event, it can be trickier to keep up your usual good habits. Hand washing stations (hydroalcoholic gel) will be available at various locations. We strongly encourage you to carry hand sanitizer with you and wash your hands regularly with soap and water.
