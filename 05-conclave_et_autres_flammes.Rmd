# CONCLAVE & OTHER FLAMES {-}

<h2><span> BURN BARRELS </span></h2> 

A “burn barrel” (or other authorized fire device) is a device for safely starting a fire and spreading its heat, while avoiding becoming a fire spreader. To comply with L’OsstidBurn requirements, it must meet specific criteria, i.e. have legs, have a clearance of 15 centimeters (6 inches) from the ground, and be covered by a grate with holes smaller than ½ inch (1cm) to prevent embers from escaping. In addition, before operating a burn barrel or other authorized fire device, the ground must be swept clear of all leaves and twigs in a perimeter around the device that is equivalent to its height. In other words, a burn barrel that is 1 meter (3 feet) high should have a clear perimeter around it of 1 meter (3 feet). Each burn barrel must constantly have a full 5 Gallon water bucket nearby to be able to put it out when lit.

NO GROUND FIRES

Do not dig fire pits or light fires directly on the ground. Only use designated or authorized burn barrels—share the warmth, not the risk.

Burn only dead wood found on the ground, fallen leaves, or small branches. Cutting live wood is strictly forbidden. Do not burn plastic, painted or treated wood, or any other materials.

WANT TO BRING YOUR OWN BURN BARREL?

Each camp may bring and manage their own burn barrel. To do so, you must first submit an official request to the FAST team (Fire & Art Safety en Tabouère): fast@losstidburn.org

**During the event, BEFORE LIGHTING, all fire devices must be verified and authorized on site by a FAST member.**

Camping stoves are permitted for cooking, but no ground fires are allowed in the camping areas. Ensure that you have a fire extinguisher in a visible location near your kitchen area.

Unmodified gas appliances approved by an organization recognized by the RBQ (e.g.: radiant heaters) are allowed.

Usage conditions for these devices:

* A sober operator must be present at all times when the device is active.
* The device must be placed on a stable surface in a clear space
* Clear all leaves and twigs within a 1.5 m radius and make sure the space above is unobstructed
* All fuel (propane, gasoline, etc.) must be kept at least 10 m away from the device in use
* A fire extinguisher must be visible and within 5 m at all times

Pyrotechnics or fireworks are **NOT ALLOWED**. Portable oil torches (tiki torches), or any other type of open flame torch or candle are **NOT PERMITTED** at the event as well.

<h2><span>EFFIGY & TEMPLE</span></h2>

The Effigy Burn ceremony is scheduled for Sunday at sunset.

The Temple is an intentional co-creation space. A team of volunteers has built a monument that serves as a blank canvas for our collective reflection and emotional release. Throughout the event, OsstidBurners are invited to write messages, leave mementos, spend a quiet moment, hold a ritual, or do anything meaningful to them to honor what they wish to let go of.

If that’s not your thing, no worries—but please treat the space and the personal items within it with respect.

If you stay until the end of the event, you’ll have the privilege of witnessing the Temple Burn—a communal moment in which we symbolically release what we’re ready to leave behind. The Temple Burn ceremony is scheduled for Monday at sunset.

Both the Effigy and the Temple are participatory art pieces. If you want to help build them, come by the Plana during the week to join the crew!

If you'd like to be part of the fire safety perimeter for the Effigy or Temple Burn, sign up via the volunteer platform: https://participation.losstidburn.org 


* If there’s a fire ban during the event, there will be no Burn. 

<h2><span>FIRE ART</h2></span>

All flame effects must be pre-registered prior to the event. It must also be inspected and approved before activation by the FAST (Fire Art Safety Team).

<h2><span> FIRE PERFORMANCES </h2></span>

**CONCLAVE**  

Fire installations and fire performance art are welcome during the Conclave, which takes place just before the Effigy is ignited. Want to perform? Email us at: participation@losstidburn.org 

A safety meeting will be held in the afternoon for all Conclave performers to ensure coverage under our insurance. You’ll then need to arrive on-site 1 hour before the show. A safety team will be present throughout the performances, and the organization will provide all necessary safety equipment.

Due to fire risk, fire spinning is only allowed in this designated and secured area.


**FIRE JAM**

Outside of the Conclave, there will be no designated Fire Jam Space during the event.
That said, feel free to flow **FLAMELESS** anywhere you like with your friends.
