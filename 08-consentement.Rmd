# CONSENT {-}

1.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Consent applies to all types of interactions with two or more people </span> (hugging, talking, touching, dancing, sex, sitting near someone...)

2. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Unanimous, explicit and renewable </span>
  
  
  * Any interaction (physical or otherwise) requires <span style="text-decoration:underline">  EXPLICIT consent of all persons  </span> involved in the exchange. 
  * <span style="text-decoration:underline"> Consent should always be CLEAR, VERBAL, BEFORE action and RENEWABLE. </span> 
  * Consent can be withdrawn at any time: any interaction can be stopped at any time by those involved, without justification.


3. <span style="text-decoration:underline"> In search of the enthusiastic YES </span> 
  
* Each person strives to find conditions in an interaction that produce an authentic & enthusiastic YES, before and during the interaction.
* If you are not 100% sure you want an interaction, it may be better to stay in a NO.
* A NO is a complete answer and does not require any justification or explanation. When everyone wishes it, it is certainly possible to negotiate to find an ENTHUSIASTIC YES.


4.<span style="text-decoration:underline"> Nudity, clothing, costume or behaviour DOES NOT constitute an invitation to any interaction. </span> 
  
  
5. <span style="text-decoration:underline"> Consent must be FREE and CONSCIOUS.</span> Someone who is asleep or coerced cannot consent. Substance use (alcohol, drugs, cannabis...) or even sexual energy and physical closeness can affect awareness. Extra caution is needed if you are using substances or interacting with someone whose state of consciousness might be altered.
  
Everyone involved must fully understand what they are consenting to: <span style="text-decoration:underline"> this is called informed consent. </span> 


6. <span style="text-decoration:underline"> Collective responsibility </span> 
Like all other principles, consent is everyone’s responsibility. The OsstidBurn community is committed to integrating these values with care and making sure they’re upheld—for yourself and others—as both participants and witnesses.

Everyone is responsible for checking in with partners, clearly naming their YESes and NOs, and respecting the limits communicated at all times.


Living by these principles helps create a safer space for everyone to assert and have their NOs respected. 


**WHAT TO DO IF YOU WITNESS OR EXPERIENCE A VIOLATION OF CONSENT?**

* If a participant seems to be making others uncomfortable or crossing clearly expressed boundaries, speak up.
* If you don’t feel safe intervening directly, approach the **Rangers**.   
* If you feel in danger, remove yourself from the situation immediately and find Sentinels or Rangers.
* We encourage you to report any inappropriate behavior to the  **Rangers**.
* The organization reserves the right to expel anyone who behaves inappropriately.
* After the event, if you wish to report a consent violation, feel free to contact us at:  <span style="text-decoration:underline">conduct@losstidburn.org </span> 

<h2><span> CONDUCT COMMITTEE  </span></h2>

The Conduct Committee isn’t a new body—it’s the natural evolution of the Consent Committee. The name change better reflects our expanded mission, aligned with the needs of a growing community, and helps clarify our role.

Our main focus remains consent: awareness-building, managing reports, implementing appropriate measures, and supporting camps upon request.

Our scope has widened. The Conduct Committee also supports the community with situations involving bullying, harassment, discrimination, abuse of power, or non-consensual dosing.

We’re here to support committees, camps, and participants dealing with interpersonal or organizational issues. Our role is both preventive and responsive: being present before situations escalate, in order to foster a healthy, respectful, and safe Burn environment for everyone.


To contact the Conduct Committee, write to conduct@losstidburn.org. This inbox is monitored by Camille C., Elizabeth V., Antonia S., Cléo G., and Meddy B. If any of them are involved in the situation—or for any other reason—you may contact at least two members directly:

* camille@losstidburn.org
* cleo@losstidburn.org
* elizabeth@losstidburn.org
* antonia@losstidburn.org


Note : The old address consent@losstidburn.org is still active. It is currently monitored only by Elizabeth V. and Antonia S. to ensure continuity with previous messages.

<h2><span> PHOTOGRAPHY </span></h2>

Taking photos or videos of participants without their consent is prohibited. Always ask before taking photos!

Respect any “No photography” or “Pas de photo” signs.

<h2><span>PARENTS</span></h2>

Prepare your children: explain ahead of time what they might see or hear—nudity, provocative art, vulgar language, and/or strange behaviors are part of the experience.

When you arrive at OsstidBurn, take a walk through the site with your kids and help them locate key landmarks. Visit Safety HQ. Our Rangers will have tips for you, and it’s also a safe place where lost kids can go if needed.
