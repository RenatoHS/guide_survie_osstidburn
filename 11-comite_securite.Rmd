# SECURITY {-}

We are Burners, we care for our community. We mediate, offer conflict resolution assistance, and act in emergencies. 

If you need help, you can find us at Safety HQ. You can find the location on the map.

Rangers are volunteer sober participants that are here to help you in case of problems or emergencies. You can usually spot them wearing a forest green shirt and/or a green light. They patrol in groups of two and are equipped with radios so they can communicate more quickly with other teams if needed. The First Aid volunteers are on call and can be reached by radio, especially via the Rangers. If you feel caught in an uncomfortable situation, the Rangers and First Aid will be there to support you. Sanctuary volunteers can also accommodate you and provide you with a more secure, well-lit and weatherproof space.

The Sanctuary is a calm place for participants who are going through a difficult experience and feel the need to be supported during this time. Volunteers will be on site at all times to answer any questions, keep company or just have a good chat. Cozy with pillows and soft blankets, lit up, warm and dry: it is a place to relax and ground yourself. There will also be activities, discussions and workshops on consent, cultural appropriation and safer drug use. Clean and sterile safer drug use and safer sex supplies will be available around the clock, as well as information of all sorts about drugs and sexuality.

Please exercise caution. Take care of your friends and yourself. Remember to drink water and to eat. And have fun!
We have medical supplies at Safety HQ. Come see us if you don’t have what you need in your own first aid kit.

At night, make sure you can see and be seen. Always  carry at least one flashlight or headlamp.
