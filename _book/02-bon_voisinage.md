# GOOD NEIGHBOURS {-} 

Maintaining a good relationship with local residents is essential for the future of OsstidBurn on this land we’ve temporarily made our own.


**We’re counting on your collaboration to ensure everything flows in harmony.**

<h2><span>SOUND, PARTIES & GATHERINGS</span></h2> 

* No music, sound systems, events, or parties are allowed in the parking area or on the open field.

<h2><span>DRIVING IN THE TOWNSHIP</span></h2> 

* Drive slowly in the Township of Potton. In order to reduce noise pollution from car traffic, arrive during Gate opening hours, respect the speed limit and avoid excessive noise (e.g. techno at full volume).
* Respect the signs delimiting the site, otherwise you'll be asked to move your tent. We're surrounded by private property.


<h2><span>PARKING</span></h2> 

* **NO PARKING ON THE ROAD **.  
* You should have a parking pass to enter the site.

No pass? Carpool or hop on the OsstidBus: https://losstidburn.org/en/transportation/

<h2><span>SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES</span></h2> 

A great way to thank the host community is to spend your money locally—with a smile! In the village, you’ll find an excellent bakery, a coffee roaster, and a convenience store/hardware shop.

<h2><span>LEAVE NO TRACE</span></h2> 

* As always: pack it in, pack it out. Leave the place cleaner than you found it.
