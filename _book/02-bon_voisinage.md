# GOOD NEIGHBOURS {-} 

We have new neighbours. Yes, real estate development has also affected the Township of Potton. Keeping a good relationship with them is critical for the sustainability of the event on this site that we have made our own.

**This is why we are asking for everyone's collaboration.**

* No music, sound systems, events or gatherings, including parties, will be tolerated on the clearing or in the parking lot.
* In order to reduce noise pollution from car traffic, arrive during Gate opening hours, respect the speed limit and avoid excessive noise (e.g. psytrance at full volume).
* Respect the signs delimiting the site, otherwise you'll be asked to move your tent. We're surrounded by private property.
