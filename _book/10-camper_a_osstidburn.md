# CAMPING & STUFF {-}

<h2><span>CAMPING AT OSSTIDBURN</span></h2> 

Themed camps will be located in clearly marked zones. If you’re not part of a theme camp, set up in the free camping area.

There will be sound camps playing amplified music at night. Keep that in mind when choosing your spot. Light sleepers may prefer the higher ground near the field for quieter nights.

We are just a few hundred meters from the U.S. border. Don’t wander off in that direction. For your freedom’s sake, stay within the site boundaries. We don’t want to lose you to American troopers ;)

At night, walk with a buddy. There are bears around. But note: bears don’t like loud music—so don’t worry too much.

<h2><span> TOILETS / PORTA-POTTIES </span></h2>  

Take care of them and leave them clean for the next person.

**WHAT GOES IN THE TOILET**

* What comes out of your beautiful body
* Single-ply toilet paper only


**DO NOT PUT in Porta-Potties:** tampons, pads, paper towels, diapers, cigarette butts, or any trash. Bring a bag with you to dispose of these items properly.

<h2><span> GENERATORS </span></h2>

Be responsible when using generators to avoid contaminating the soil or water. Fuel spills are hazardous to both participants and the forest. Gasoline fires are extremely dangerous and increase the risk of forest fires.

If you have questions about using your generator safely in the forest, please contact Rangers or FAST.

* All fuel must be stored at least 3 meters (10 feet) from the generator, and 15 meters (50 feet) from any fire or open flame. 
* Never run a generator inside a sleeping tent or sealed container.
* In case of a fuel spill, contact the Rangers immediately.
* Don’t leave your generator running if you don’t need it. Turn it off when not in use.
* Don't turn off a generator that isn’t yours—unless there’s an emergency. Try to find the owner if it’s bothering you.
* Clear all leaves and twigs within 1.5 meters (5 feet) of your generator.
* Always keep a fire extinguisher visible and within 5 meters (16 feet) of your generator.
* Coiled extension cords can overheat and catch fire when carrying high current. Keep them away from fuel and generators.

<h2><span> SOUND POLICY </span></h2>

"DON’T ROT OTHERS"

The SoundCore policy guide is available on the L’OsstidBurn website:
https://losstidburn.org/en/reports-and-policies/

The SoundCore team trusts sound system operators to self-regulate and use good judgment as they adapt to the unique dynamics of a burn.

There will be no “sound police” patrolling the site—but the rules are clear: **any participant** has the right to check in with a camp (and its decibel meter) to verify its sound level.
 
 
* All category 1+ sound systems (see the guide) must register before the event.
* Maximum limit at all times: **100 decibels at 5 meters** (dBC weighting).
* **Quiet hours**  (no amplified sound or generators) are between 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday (from 6AM until GTFO).
* A sound operator must be nearby while the system is running. Amplified systems must never be left on unattended (exceptions can be made for art installations at reasonable volume).
* Exceptional situation may require exceptional measures.

This policy may change during the event—we aim to maintain a good relationship with the town and neighbors, so please cooperate if a Sound Core member asks you to lower your volume. **And definitely don’t turn it back up 20 minutes later.**


After two warnings, you’ll be required to shut off your sound for the remainder of the event.

Participants always have the right to politely share their thoughts on a sound camp’s volume. Sound camps are free to consider or ignore the comment, as long as they’re respecting the rules.
Let’s all do our best to put ourselves in others’ shoes and avoid unnecessary migraines—whether from sound or drama.
