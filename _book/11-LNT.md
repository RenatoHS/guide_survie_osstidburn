<h2><span> LEAVE NO TRACE (LNT) </span></h2> 


At OsstidBurn, we respect the land that welcomes us. We come, we live, we leave—without a trace. Better yet: we aim to leave the place better than we found it.
There will be no trash containers on-site or at the exit. So bring back **everything you brought**, including your trash (yes, even your apple core). Bring strong garbage bags, containers for leftovers, and tools to manage your own mess.

And please: **no peeing in the wild**, especially not near the river!

COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY

Keeping the site clean is everyone’s job. Always carry a small bag to pick up trash you see—even if it’s not yours. And most importantly, join the final MOOP sweep in addition to cleaning up your own camp. It’s a fun, muddy, and rewarding collective moment.


**MOOP?? WHAT'S THAT**

MOOP = **Matter Out Of Place**. It refers to anything that doesn’t originally belong to the land where the event is held.

Cigarette butts, bottle caps, glowsticks, fireworks, feathers, glitter, confetti, broken bits of wood, plastic, costume pieces, metal, or glass…

Even organic matter (yes, even biodegradable) counts as MOOP. If everyone tossed an apple core in the woods, the site would quickly become a dump—and attract animals. Our environmental impact must be as minimal as possible.

Unlike mainstream festivals, **there are no waste or recycling facilities** on an LNT event site. Everything you bring to OsstidBurn must leave with you—including your trash. Make sure to dispose of it responsibly after the event.

**FINAL MOOP SWEEP**

The LNT team ensures the woods stay in good condition—or better than before we arrived. A collective site cleanup will take place on **Tuesday, June 24 from 2:00 PM to 6:30 PM.** To join, sign up on the volunteer platform:  https://participation.losstidburn.org/ 

<h2><span>MOOP MAP</span></h2>

A MOOP Map is created after each edition of OsstidBurn, based on data gathered during the MOOP Sweep (photos of collected MOOP). It shows how clean each camp, art installation, and shared space was left before the final sweep.

This data is reviewed by the LNT committee and used to determine placement for camps and artists in future editions.

**_The field, parking areas, paths, woods, and the river are shared spaces. As a participant, you’re just as responsible for those as you are for your own campsite._**
