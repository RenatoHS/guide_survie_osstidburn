# SECURITY {-}

We’re Burners, and we take care of our community. We mediate, help resolve conflict, and respond to emergencies. If you need help, visit us at **HQ Safety**. You'll find it marked on the map.

<h2><span>RANGERS & FIRST AID</span></h2> 

Rangers are sober volunteer participants who are here to help in case of problems or emergencies. You can spot them by their forest green vests and/or green lights. They patrol in pairs and carry radios to communicate quickly with other teams if needed.

First Aid volunteers are easily recognizable with their blue vests and backpacks marked with a cross. They’re on call and reachable by radio—you might also see them around the OsstidBurn grounds.

If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, the Rangers and First Aid team are here to support you. Volunteers from the Sanctuary can also welcome you and offer a safer, sheltered, and calm environment.

<h2><span>SANCTUARY</span></h2> 

The Sanctuary is a quiet, safe space for participants going through a difficult experience who need support. Day and night, volunteers are available to answer questions, offer companionship, or just hold space for a good conversation.

The Sanctuary is designed to be relaxing—filled with cushions and soft blankets, dry, warm, shaded, and well-lit. There will be snacks and hot tea available. Risk reduction supplies (e.g., condoms, dental dams, gloves, etc.) will be freely accessible, along with a wide variety of information on drugs and sexuality.


<h2><span>AND...</span></h2> 

Please be cautious. Take care of your friends and yourself. Drink water, eat food. And have fun!
We have medical supplies at **HQ Safety**. Come see us if you don’t have what you need in your own first aid kit.

At night, make sure you can see and be seen. Always carry at least one flashlight or headlamp.
