# EXODUS {-}

<h2><span>LOST & FOUNDS</span></h2>

This year, the Lost & Found station will be at Safety HQ. That’s where you can drop off objects you find or recover your preciousssss.

<h2><span>EXODUS</span></h2>

PACK OUT WHAT YOU PACK IN!!

All participants (except LNT volunteers) must leave the property by 2PM, June 26th. Considering the high volume of traffic on the path during exodus, a schedule for vehicles will be set up with time slots reserved for entering and exiting the path. Please take this into consideration when planning your departure. The Leave No Trace session will run from 2PM to 6PM.


Take time to do a MOOP sweep of your campsite and other areas you frequented before leaving.

Every piece of waste must be picked up.

Everyone in line!

Stay one meter apart.

Walk forward and pick up everything you see! MOOP OUT!

**MOOP OUT!**
