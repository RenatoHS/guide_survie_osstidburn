PACK OUT WHAT YOU PACK IN!!

All participants (except LNT volunteers) must leave the property by 2PM, June 24th.

Please take this into consideration when planning your departure. The Leave No Trace session will run from 2PM to 6:30PM.

As in the arrival  only 4-wheel-drive vehicles with 12 inches of ground clearance may be permitted on the trail, depending on terrain conditions.

Take time to do a MOOP sweep of your campsite and other areas you frequented before leaving.

Every piece of waste must be picked up.

Everyone in line!

Stay one meter apart.

Walk forward and pick up everything you see! MOOP OUT!
