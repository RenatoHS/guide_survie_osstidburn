<h2><span> FOREWORD </span></h2> 

Everything at L’OsstidBurn is organized and run by volunteers.  

Volunteering is a great way to contribute and participate in the event. There are many ways  to get involved: Gate, First Aid, Rangers, Sanctuary, Fire Perimeter, Department of  Public Works (DPW), etc.

All L’OsstidBurn participants are encouraged to take on a minimum of two shifts during the event. When you purchased your ticket, you received the link to the volunteer platform (below). Go pick your shifts now if you haven’t already!

Make sure you have a ticket first – signing up for shifts will not get you a ticket. ;-)
