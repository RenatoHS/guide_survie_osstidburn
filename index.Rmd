# THE GUIDE THAT YOU MUST READ {-}

<img src="www/logo_2024_EDITED.png"  width=100% height=50%>

<h2><span> FOREWORD </span></h2> 

OsstidBurn isn't a festival. Itâ€™s an event rooted in a global culture inspired by Burning Man, based on [10 core Principles](https://survival.losstidburn.org/burning-man-10-principes) that guide the experience of burners (including you!).

All participants are asked to fill at least two volunteer shifts during the event. If you already have your ticket, youâ€™ve also received a link to the volunteer platform (below). Go choose your shifts now if you havenâ€™t already: https://participation.losstidburn.org

And donâ€™t forget to update your info.
Important: signing up as a volunteer does NOT replace the need to buy a ticket. ðŸ˜‰
